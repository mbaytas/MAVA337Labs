### MAVA 337 Introduction to Programming for Design  (2016 Spring)

# Assignment 3: Arduino

This homework assignment concludes our coverage of the third programming environment you encounter during this course: Arduino. We will collect and grade your work. The grading rubric is given below.

Feel free to consult any course materials or outside sources. Feel free to use code you have written before.

### Academic Honesty

You are expected to observe the code of academic honesty that is included in the course syllabus. Please don't copy each other's work. We will know if you do. However, we will not be able to know who supplied the code and who copied it, so both parties will suffer if we detect cheating.

Remember that you can rely on any resources, including any sinippets code you find online. If you use other people's code, *put a comment in your code which says where you got the snippet from (provide a link), and what exactly it does*.

### Submission Instructions

Put all four project directories inside a directory called `3_Arduino_YourName`. Compress it into a `.zip` file with the same name. E-mail it to the instructor and the TA (see the syllabus for the contact information).

Due 23:59 on May 5, 2016.

### Grading Rubric

- Comments on classes, methods, and reasonable chunks of code explaining what they do: 2 points
- Properly indented code: 1 points
- Good style (properly capitalized variable names, etc.): 1 points

These add up to 25 points, which represents 25% of your final grade from this course.
