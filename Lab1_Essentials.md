MAVA 337 Introduction to Programming for Design  (2016 Spring)

# Lab 1: Java and BlueJ Essentials

> Labs are class hours dedicated to give you the opportunity to do some practical programming exercises. Today’s exercises are given below. We will be walking around answering your questions, and we will take the time to explain things to the whole class if a number of you stumble upon the same issues. Feel free to ask questions not only about the exercises, but also about more basic things or more advanced tips and tricks.

This lab relates to the first lecture, where the essential "components" of Java were covered.

To survive this lab, make sure you are familiar with the terms below. If you are not familiar with any of these terms, please ask us.

- class
- object
- data type
- method
- expression
- assignment
- documentation
- debugging

During this lab, you will be developing a piece of software for the university’s campus security. Since parking space on the campus is limited, the university needs to limit the number of cars coming in by charging a fee from students who wish to use the parking facilities. Campus security needs to keep track of the cars that belong to people who have paid their fees. Until now, they have been using pen and paper to do this. You will help them catch up with technology.

## 1)Setting Up BlueJ

We are hoping that you already have BlueJ up and running on your computer. If not, please go to bluej.org now to download the latest version of the BlueJ for your operating system, and install it on your computer.

## 2)	Creating a Java Project in BlueJ

Use BlueJ’s Project menu to create a New Project. Notice that before you write any code at all, you will need to decide on the project’s name, and where it will live on your computer. Name your project “Campus Parking Records” and place it somewhere you can find later.

> It might be wise to make a “MAVA 337” folder to keep all of your projects for this course. The path that I would use would look like the following:
“…/MAVA 337 Intro to Programming for Design/Java/Lab 1 – Essentials/2 First Java Program/”

> Once the project is created, visit the folder where you put the project and have a look at the contents. Notice that there are two files: package.bluej and README.TXT. package.bluej is your main project file that describes your project to BlueJ. README.TXT describes your project to the general public, which includes people who may or may not have BlueJ.
 
## 3)	Classes

In Java, you fill find that most of your code will be structured around classes. Classes are essentially blueprints/models for objects, which are how your data is represented in the computer.

In our project, for now, we need to represent data about one thing only: cars.

Create a New Class named “Car”.

> Notice that the name of  our class is “Car”. Two things are interesting about this name: First, it is singular – “Car”, not “Cars”; because this class describes how you will represent information about a single car, not a collection of cars. Second, it starts with a capital “C”, because that is a “convention” among Java programmers and it makes easier for other people to read and understand your code.

> In the window that pops up when you click the New Class button, you will see options where you can change the class type. For now, select “Class” (which is already pre-selected, so you don’t have to do anything about it). Don’t worry about the rest of the options.

Double-click the “Car” class in the BlueJ window to see the code for your class.

Now visit your project folder. Notice that there is a new file there called “Car.java”. This file was generated by BlueJ when you created the class. Open this file using a text editor. Compare the contents to the contents of the BlueJ window for the “Car” class. Be amazed. Close the text editor.

## 4) Documentation

In BueJ’s window for the “Car” class, let’s go over the code. The first section of code begins with the symbols “/*” and ends with the symbols “*/”. These two symbols denote the beginning and the end of comments. Comments are used to provide documentation about your code to other programmers who may have to read and understand what you have done.
