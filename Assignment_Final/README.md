### MAVA 337 Introduction to Programming for Design  (2016 Spring)

# Final Project Assignment

This homework assignment concludes the course, and integrates two of the tools you acquired throughout the term: **Processing** and **Arduino**. We will collect and grade your work. The grading rubric is given below.

Feel free to consult any course materials or outside sources. Feel free to use code you have written before.

### Academic Honesty

You are expected to observe the code of academic honesty that is included in the course syllabus. Please don't copy each other's work. We will know if you do. However, we will not be able to know who supplied the code and who received it, so both parties will suffer if we detect cheating.

Remember that you can rely on any resources, including any sinippets code you find online. If you use other people's code, *put a comment in your code which says where you got the snippet from (provide a link), and what exactly it does*.

### Submission Instructions

Put all four project directories inside a directory called `4_Final_YourName`. Compress it into a `.zip` file with the same name. E-mail it to the instructor and the TA (see the syllabus for the contact information).

Due 23:59 on May 18, 2016.

### Grading Rubric

- Comments on classes, methods, and reasonable chunks of code explaining what they do: 1 points
- Properly indented code: 1 points
- Good style (properly capitalized variable names, etc.): 1 points

These add up to 25 points, which represents 25% of your final grade from this course.

## Scenario

Using Arduino and Processing, you will be building a small prototype of a digital music player with a dedicated hardware controller.

### Bill of Materials

- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x USB cable
- 1x breadboard
- Jumper wires
- 3x LEDs
- 3x 220 ohm resistors
- 1x rotary potentiometer
- 3x MP3 audio files

### Part 1: Processing

We'll begin by building a music player in Processing.

- Add your three MP3 files to the Processing project.
- Create canvas for the user interface (UI), sized 800x600 pixels.
- Create three buttons for the **Play/Pause**, **Rewind**, and **Fast-Forward** functions. The shape and size of the buttons are up to you. When clicked, the **Play/Pause** button should start or pause the audio, and the other two buttons should switch between audio files.
- Indicate the name of the currently playing sound file on the UI with [text](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html). Make sure this text updates when you change the file that is playing.
- Indicate the volume level with text, numbers, or any UI widget of your liking.
