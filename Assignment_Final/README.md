### MAVA 337 Introduction to Programming for Design  (2016 Spring)

# Final Project Assignment

This homework assignment concludes the course, using one of the tools you acquired throughout the term: **Processing**. We will collect and grade your work. The grading rubric is given below.

Feel free to consult any course materials or outside sources. Feel free to use code you have written before.

### Academic Honesty

You are expected to observe the code of academic honesty that is included in the course syllabus. Please don't copy each other's work. We will know if you do. However, we will not be able to know who supplied the code and who received it, so both parties will suffer if we detect cheating.

Remember that you can rely on any resources, including any sinippets code you find online. If you use other people's code, *put a comment in your code which says where you got the snippet from (provide a link), and what exactly it does*.

### Instructions, Deadlines, and Grading

We will be collecting your work for the final project in three stages.

#### 1) Project Plan + Initial Concept

**Deadline: 25 April, 2016** ::: *2 Points*

Write up a 1-page summary/proposal for the project you would like to develop using Processing. Include a "project plan" that explains which portions of the work you'll be doing each week, until the final submission deadline.

Your project should integrate the concepts you have learned throughout the class.

Make a PDF called `4_1_Proposal_YourName.pdf` (1 page max.). E-mail it to the instructor and the TA (see the syllabus for the contact information).

You will subsequently receive feedback on your project and your work plan, which will probably make your life significantly easier.

#### 2) Progress Report

**Deadline: 4 May, 2016** ::: *5 Points*

Write up a 1-page progress report that explains what you have done so far. If you are ahead of or behind schedule, indicate why, and indicate how you intend to use your time more efficiently during the rest of the time you'll spend on your project.

Make a PDF called `4_2_Progress_YourName.pdf` (1 page max.). E-mail it to the instructor and the TA (see the syllabus for the contact information).

Your progress report will be graded not only based on its existence and format, but also based on the relationship between the work you planned to do and the work you have actually done. You will also receive feedback, if we get any ideas which can make your life easier.

#### 3) Project Submission

**18 May, 2016** ::: *18 Points*

The following is a breakdown of the 18-point "Project Submission + Demo" portion of the points for this assignment:

- Properly styled, commented, and working code ::: *5 Points*
- Novel concept that integrates learning throughout the course ::: *5 Points*
- Working application ::: *8 Marks*

Put all four project directories inside a directory called `4_3_Final_YourName`. Compress it into a .zip file with the same name. E-mail it to the instructor and the TA (see the syllabus for the contact information).
